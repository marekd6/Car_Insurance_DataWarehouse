to do: 
== DB (star, snowflake or constellation)
== dimensional model: granularity, measures (value+agg fun)
== feasibility - use only the measures that are defined in dim model
== data - is data from sources matching db

== one calculated measure
== >=3 measures
== date dimension
== a few dimensions
== >=1 fact table
== star, snowflake or constellation
== verbose dimension attributes
== careful with attribute types
== if data necessary for warehouse is in sources
== >=1 SCD, generate data for it (Car - colour, Client - exp, age, voi)
== >=1 hierarchical dimension
== all queries feasible
